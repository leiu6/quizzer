# Quizzer

## Introduction

Welcome to Quizzer! Quizzer is a web app to create interactive quizzes.

Quizzer is simple! With a simple GUI interface JSON quiz files can be created and then questions can be randomly selected from them to quiz the user. The answers are then verified and the user is scored to gamify the studying process.

## Anticipated Features

- Quiz question sets stored in JSON and dynamically loaded
- Built in grading system to turn studying into a game
- GUI panel to edit JSON quizzes and add new questions
- Node.js and Express.js backend to allow local storage of the quiz files

Currently this project is in development. Right now, I am in the process of implementing the grading system.

## Conclusion

Currently this project is in development and is not even at the first version. Many of the features will be janky, or just won't work. So proceed with caution.

# Quizzer

## Introduction

Welcome to Quizzer! Quizzer is a web app that I am creating to be able to create quizzes. This project is great for students who need to test themselves over subjects.

## Anticipated Features

- Quiz question sets stored in JSON and dynamically loaded
- Built in grading system to turn studying into a game
- GUI panel to edit JSON quizzes and add new questions
- Node.js and Express.js backend to allow local storage of the quiz files

Currently this project is in development. Right now, I am in the process of implementing the grading system.
